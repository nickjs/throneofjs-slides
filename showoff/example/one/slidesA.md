# Third Slide

* Sometimes bullet items
  * Have sublists
  * And some sublist items
    * Have some of their own
    * And so on
* But top-level "bullet items" have no bullets
  * isn't that odd?

Also, sometimes you just want to have plain text sitting in the middle
of the screen. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
