# batman.js 1.0 #

.notes the big production-ready 1.0 of batman along with the launch of our own shopify 2.
We're pretty confident in it by now to use it in our production app.
I'll also be showing off Shopify 2 in a case study session later today.

# complete docs and guides #

.notes As we've ramped up more developers on the project, we've had to really build out the documentation to get them up to speed.
This has been one of our biggest complaints so far. We're really excited to finally improve the situation.

You should follow it. It will be cool.

![question](question.jpg)

!SLIDE
# is batman.js the framework for you? #

!SLIDE
## you should use batman.js if: ##

* you want to write in coffeescript to make your life easy
* you want to follow specific, Rails-like conventions to make your life easy
* you/your designer want to layout your UI and bindings in HTML
* you have a separate, ideally RESTful, API component

.notes let's refer back to chart one.

.notes Everything is great. Here's just a few things to keep in mind before choosing open source your software.

# how many of these features am I actually going to need? #

.notes because the ones you don't use you won't support and they will jaundice

# are you contributing new knowledge or repurposing existing techniques? #

.notes Both are absolutely necessary, but it helps to know how to position yourself.

!SLIDE
# is this framework built in a way that will make me _enjoy_ using it? #

.notes Cause if you don't who will? Maybe sometimes it's worth just looking at how
to make your own. And that's really easy too.

!SLIDE
# just start building your app. #

.notes Don't waste time trying to pick the best framework before you start, and just start writing.
Whenever you write the same function twice, pull it out. That's your "framework," and that framework
will do EXACTLY what you want in EXACTLY the right way. The main thing you'll lose is some of the
knowledge generated by people already working on these problems, but hopefully you can generate
some of your own.

# so. #

.notes I have an idea. What if we all just used or built the tool that's best for us?
What if we concentrated on the technical problems in front of us instead of the environmental ones?
Then we could all just shut the fuck up and
